            <h3>Struggler and Learner </h3>
            <p>You might saw me trading forex, making sushi, and delivering goods. But i love programming. As well as
                Web
                Developers have completely different mindsets to those who don't program. Through the act of programming
                and
                using an entirely different language, they have the ability of seeing the world from another
                perspective,
                helping them to solve seemingly complex problems in any area of life. That's why I am learning and
                mastering
                web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.</p>
